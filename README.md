# Stroop Task Analysis

## Overview
This exercise was one of my first projects done using Python to analyze a dataset. The analysis examines a dataset with results of the Stroop task for 24 participants. The exercise was done as a part of a Udacity course, and the questions asked by the course are answered in the Jupyter Notebook file.

### Findings
The analysis of the data demonstrated the [Stroop Effect](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-stroop-effect-2795832), showing that the reaction time to name the ink color for words congruent with ink color is faster than words incongruent with ink color.

### Concepts and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
